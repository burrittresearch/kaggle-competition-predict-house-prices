Submission for the kaggle closed competition [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques').

## Project: Kaggle Competition: Predict House Prices

We used a variety of data wrangling and feature engineering techniques to prepare the datasets. We then used multiple linear regression to build a model using the training dataset to the predict the SalePrice of houses. When we compare the actual vs predict SalePrice using the our model, the results were mixed. As a result, we could do further refining of the model to improve results. Finally, we applied our model to the competition dataset and submitted our results.
